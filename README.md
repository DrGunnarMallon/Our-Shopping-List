# Our Shopping List

A fun little project to practice/learn Flutter and Dart. For iOS and Android.

Our Shopping List is a shared shopping list system, that uses Firebase under the hood to allow people (my wife and I) to share items for various shopping lists.

## Basic functionality

- Shared shopping list
- Shopping categories (to segment the grocery list)
- CRUD items
- Picture gallery for quick adding items
- Saved list
- Auto add after time period

## Current status

The project is still very barebone and doesn't work yet. Once finished it'll be released on both Play Store and Apple Store.
